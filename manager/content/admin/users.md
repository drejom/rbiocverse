Manage user accounts and SSH keys.

:::widget UserTable:::

## Actions

- **Delete Key** - Remove a user's managed SSH key (forces re-setup)
- **Delete User** - Remove user account entirely
- **Bulk Operations** - Select multiple users for batch actions

> **Note:** You cannot regenerate a user's key - this requires their password. Users must regenerate their own keys.
